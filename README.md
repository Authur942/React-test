<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# react脚手架配置代理总结

## 方法一

> 在package.json中追加如下配置

```json
"proxy":"http://localhost:5000"
```

说明：

1. 优点：配置简单，前端请求资源时可以不加任何前缀。
2. 缺点：不能配置多个代理。
3. 工作方式：上述方式配置代理，当请求了3000不存在的资源时，那么该请求会转发给5000 （优先匹配前端资源）



## 方法二

1. 第一步：创建代理配置文件

   ```
   在src下创建配置文件：src/setupProxy.js
   ```

2. 编写setupProxy.js配置具体代理规则：

   ```js
   const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware')
   
   module.exports = function(app) {
     app.use(
       proxy('/api1', {  //api1是需要转发的请求(所有带有/api1前缀的请求都会转发给5000)
         target: 'http://localhost:5000', //配置转发目标地址(能返回数据的服务器地址)
         changeOrigin: true, //控制服务器接收到的请求头中host字段的值
         /*
         	changeOrigin设置为true时，服务器收到的请求头中的host为：localhost:5000
         	changeOrigin设置为false时，服务器收到的请求头中的host为：localhost:3000
         	changeOrigin默认值为false，但我们一般将changeOrigin值设为true
         */
         pathRewrite: {'^/api1': ''} //去除请求前缀，保证交给后台服务器的是正常请求地址(必须配置)
       }),
       proxy('/api2', { 
         target: 'http://localhost:5001',
         changeOrigin: true,
         pathRewrite: {'^/api2': ''}
       })
     )
   }
   ```

说明：

1. 优点：可以配置多个代理，可以灵活的控制请求是否走代理。
2. 缺点：配置繁琐，前端请求资源时必须加前缀。
